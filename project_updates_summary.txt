Hey! Here is a breakdown of everything we accomplished in the Real Estate project today:

1. Repository Merging:
   - I successfully merged all the latest changes uploaded by Shakir-Hs (specifically from the sprint-4 branch) into the main project. This ensured we have the most up-to-date wireframes and interface details.

2. User Registration Logic:
   - Built a robust registration system that tracks Full Name, Email, Phone, and Roles (Admin/Customer).
   - Added validation to make sure passwords match and are strong enough.
   - For security, passwords are never stored in plain text; they are fully hashed before saving.

3. Login & Authentication:
   - Implemented a secure login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
   - The backend now verifies the email, password, and even checks if the user's role matches what they are trying to log in as.
   - Users get an access and refresh token once they log in successfully.

4. Admin Project Management (CRUD):
   - Created a new "Project" entity to track real estate projects (Location, Total Floors, Launch Date, etc.).
   - Admins now have full control: they can Create, View, Update, and Delete projects.
   - Added some smart "soft delete" logic so nothing is permanently lost—projects are just hidden from the main view once deleted.
   - Put in safeguards so you can't delete a project that already has apartments listed under it.

5. System Configuration:
   - Configured the entire Django REST Framework to handle these new features smoothly.
   - Ran all database migrations to make sure the schema stays in sync.

6. Deployment & Verification:
   - Tested all endpoints with local scripts to ensure everything works perfectly.
   - Pushed the entire updated project back to GitHub so it's ready for you!

Everything is currently running and verified. Great progress today!
